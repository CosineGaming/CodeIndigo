Don't bother reading me.

Code Indigo is a 3D mystery game. Play it!

A good deal of the code here is the high tech Indigo Engine. Feel free to use it in your own projects. It is conveniently stored in the files listed here. Feel free to  place them in a folder called Indigo and put them on your include path! In the sources are some fairly good descriptions of how to use it.
Indigo.cpp / Indigo.h
World.cpp / World.h
Object.cpp / Object.h
Mesh.cpp / Mesh.h
Vertex.cpp / Vertex.h
Lighting.cpp / Lighting.h
Camera.cpp / Camera.h
Direction.cpp / Direction.h

And stuff.
